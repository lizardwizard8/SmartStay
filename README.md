# SmartStay
SmartStay is an AI-powered hotel room personalization system that predicts temperature, lighting, minibar preferences, and room direction based on guest data. It helps hotel staff deliver tailored comfort using machine learning and an easy-to-use interface.


SmartStay is an AI-powered hotel room personalization system that leverages historical guest data to predict the ideal room temperature, lighting level, minibar and preferred room orientation. The repository is organized into four main sections: a Data Set folder containing the raw Excel input; Program Scripts for data preprocessing, customer clustering, model training and the Tkinter-based GUI; Exploratory Scripts for one-off analyses; and an optional models directory holding pre-trained pickle artifacts. To get started, clone the repository, create and activate a Python 3.10+ virtual environment, install dependencies with pip install -r 

requirements.txt and run the GUI via

python src/room_personalizer_app.py

Also you may need to put the data set in the correct path.
